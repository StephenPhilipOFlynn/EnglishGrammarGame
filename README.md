The English Grammar Game is a website designed to test the user's English grammar. The website is designed as a resource for English language students and teachers, in order to assess the users understanding of grammatical concepts. 

Features
Once the user confirms via a button their intention to play, a question area opens.
The quiz begins with questions which an elementary level student may be able to answer. There are 45 questions in total, and the questions get gradually harder, with the final questions being more appropriate for upper intermediate or advanced level english students. Upon selecting each answer, the answer button turns green for a correct answer, or red for an incorrect answer. However, if an incorrect answer is given, the correct answers is not confirmed, allowing for more replay value. 
After completing the quiz, the number of correct answers estimates the user's suggested grammar level. This feature was tested with english language student to ensure the banding is appropriate.

On completion of the quiz, the user a 'play again' button appears, allowing the option to reset the quiz and start again. 
Mock social media links are also included, to suggest engaging with future updates to the quiz, or for sharing ones score.

Issues
Deployment of the website was delayed by a bug which lead to double incrementation of the code, which lead to only questions, 1,2, 4, 8 etc, displaying. This lead to redesign of the structure of the quiz. I am grateful for the support of the Code Institute tutor Martin, who suggested setting the event listeners only on loading of the page, and several other pieces of advice, that resolved this issue.

Deployment
The website was deployed to Github pages on the 4 October 2023.

Features
At the end of the quiz, the users score is displayed out of the total number of questions.
The user will also be informed as to what their score may indicate about their level of grammar, from 5 possible answer bands, elementary, pre-intermediate, intermediate, upper-intermediate and advanced.
