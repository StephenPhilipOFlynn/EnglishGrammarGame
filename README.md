The English Grammar Game is a website designed to test the user's English grammar. The website is designed as a resource for English language students and teachers, in order to assess the users understanding of grammatical concepts. 

Features
Once the user confirms via a button their intention to play, a question box opens.
The test begins with questions which an elementary level student may be able to answer. There are 45 questions in total, and the questions get gradually harder, and are more appropriate for upper intermediate or advanced level english students. 
To play again, the user can click on the central header. 
Mock social media links are also included, to suggest engaging with future updates to the quiz, or for sharing ones score.

Issues
Deployment of the website was delayed by a bug which lead to double incrementation of questions.

Deployment
The website was deployed to Github pages on the 4 October 2023.

Features
At the end of the quiz, the users score is displayed out of the total number of questions.
The user will also be informed as to what their score may indicate about their level of grammar, from 5 possible answer bands, elementary, pre-intermediate, intermediate, upper-intermediate and advanced.
