The English Grammar Game is a website designed to test the user's English grammar. The website is designed as a resource for English language students and teachers, in order to assess the users understanding of grammatical concepts. 

Features
Once the user confirms via a button their intention to play, a question area opens.
The test begins with questions which an elementary level student may be able to answer. There are 45 questions in total, and the questions get gradually harder, with the final questions more appropriate for upper intermediate or advanced level english students. Upon selecting each answer, the button turns green for a correct answer, or red for an incorrect answer. However, if an incorrect answer is given, the correct answers is not confirmed, allowing for more replay value. 
After completing the test, the number of correct answers estimates the user's suggested grammar level. This feature was tested with english language student to ensure the banding is appropriate.

On completion of the test, the user a 'play again' button appears, allowing the option to reset the test and start again. 
Mock social media links are also included, to suggest engaging with future updates to the test, or for sharing ones score.

Deployment
The website was deployed to Github pages on the 4 October 2023.
