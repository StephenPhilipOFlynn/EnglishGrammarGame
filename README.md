"The English Grammar Quiz" is a website designed to test the user's English grammar. The website is designed as a resource for English language students and teachers, in order to assess the user's understanding of grammatical concepts. The website is designed to be an online equivalent of the placement tests used for assessing prospective students grammar, or to assess their progress.

Features
Once the user confirms via a button their intention to play, a question area opens.
The quiz begins with questions which an elementary-level student may be able to answer. There are 45 questions in total, and the questions get gradually harder, with the final questions being more suitable for upper-intermediate or advanced level English students. When selecting each answer, the answer button briefly turns green for a correct answer, or red for an incorrect answer, to provide the user feedback on their choice. However, if an incorrect answer is given, the correct answers is not confirmed, allowing for more replay value. 
At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed out of the total number of questions.
The user will also be informed about what their score may indicate about their level of grammar, from 3 possible answer bands: pre-intermediate or lower, intermediate, or upper-intermediate and advanced.
After completing the quiz, the number of correct answers estimates the user's suggested grammar level. This feature was tested with English language student to ensure the banding is appropriate.

Upon completion of the quiz, a 'play again' button appears, allowing the option to reset the quiz and start again. 
Mock social media links are also included, to suggest engaging with future updates to the quiz, or for sharing ones score.

Issues
Deployment of the website was delayed by a bug which lead to double incrementation of the code. This lead to the redesign of the structure of the quiz. I am grateful for the support of the Code Institute tutor Martin, who suggested setting the event listeners only on loading of the page, that helped resolve this issue.

Deployment
The website was deployed on Github pages on the 5th October 2023.

Testing
The website has been manually tested on mobile phones, ipad size devices, a laptop and monitors to ensure that the quiz is functional on all device sizes.
Further testing by English language students led to adjustment of the outcome message bands. The HTML and CSS code was checked against validators with no issues. The javascript code was checked in JShint with no significant issues, only the use of ES6 noted.
